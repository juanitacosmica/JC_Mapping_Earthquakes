# JC_Mapping_Earthquakes
Module 13: Mapping Earthquakes with JS & APIs

# Overview of the analysis:

This module presented the way to create an interactive map to show earthquake activities around the world for certain given cities. Maps allow us to explore, understand and make decisions about our world. Our clients, Basil and Sadhana wanted to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they needed to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map.

3 parts are accomplished through this analysis and the script is available in [Earthquake_Challenge Folder](https://github.com/juanitacosmica/JC_Mapping_Earthquakes/tree/main/Earthquake_Challenge):

- D1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
- D2: Add Major Earthquake Data
- D3: Add an Additional Map

# Resources:
 
 **Data source** All data used and queries used in this analysis are available in the [Static Folders](https://github.com/juanitacosmica/JC_Mapping_Earthquakes)

  **Software** JavaScript (80.5%), HTML (17.6%), CSS (1.9%), JSON, D3, Leaflet


# Results:

When switching through the buttons we get the following 6 different options:

1. Streets View only:

2. Satellite View only:

3. Dark View only:

4. Streets View and Earthquakes

5. Streets View and Tectonic Plates

All script screenshots results are available for viewing in the [Resources Folder](https://github.com/juanitacosmica/JC_Mapping_Earthquakes/__Resources).

# Summary:

The interaction in the maps are actioned to show the following:
1. Tectonic plates
2. Last 7 days earthquakes
3. Major earthquakes with magnitude greater than 4.5

And these buttons are not limited to the above, but also allow to change the layouts to: 
1. Street view
2. Satellite view
3. Dark view

There are popup markers containing the information concerning the location and magnitude for each earthquakes. The marker features (color and diameter) are equivalent to the earthquake force, the stronger, the larger and darker the marker. Plus there is a legend providing context to the map.
